# Custom shell (name to be decided)

This repository holds the files for my custom shell, built from scratch.
I would NOT recommend this as an example for anyone wanting to use quickshell.

## ' Roadmap' 
This is not a real roadmap, just me jotting down ideas for what I want to add next.

- [ ] Simple bar
   - Current time (HH:MM:SS)
   - Battery percentage
   - Wifi status
   - Bluetooth status
- [ ] To-Do widget
  - [ ] todo.txt 
  - [ ] Sync via Syncthing
- [ ] Theming set up via config file

Ideas:
- Integrate `scrcpy` with a cool phone widget
- To-Do widget synced between phone/laptop/PC
- Theme switching?
- Colour picker like powertools
- Clipboard history
